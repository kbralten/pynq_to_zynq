# Loopback Project Repository

## Project Overview
The **Loopback Project** is a comprehensive educational resource designed to demonstrate a "Vertical Slice" of embedded systems engineering on the Zynq-7000 SoC.

Unlike standard tutorials that focus on just one layer (only FPGA, or only Linux), this project connects them all. We build a custom hardware architecture, a custom operating system, and custom software drivers, all working in unison.

## Directory Structure

This directory acts as a hybrid workspace, containing both the **Instructional Documentation** and the **Source Code Artifacts** required to complete the tutorials.

### 📚 Tutorials
The core of the project is the step-by-step documentation.
*   `index.md`: The navigational hub for the steps.
*   `loopback_step1.md` - `loopback_step9.md`: The detailed instruction manuals.

### 🧩 Hardware Source Code
*   **`axis_to_video/`**
    *   **Used in:** [Step 7: HDMI Video Output](loopback_step7.md)
    *   **Description:** This folder contains the custom Verilog RTL for the `axis_to_video` module. This core is responsible for synchronizing the AXI-Stream data from memory (VDMA) with the timing signals generated by the Video Timing Controller (VTC), allowing the FPGA to output standard 720p60 video.

### 🐧 Software Source Code
*   **`xlnx_dummy_connector/`**
    *   **Used in:** [Step 8: Linux DRM Driver](loopback_step8.md)
    *   **Description:** This folder contains the source code for a custom Linux Kernel Module (Out-Of-Tree driver).
    *   **Purpose:** The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem requires a "Connector" entity to function. Since our generic HDMI pipeline doesn't have a physical DDC/EDID channel to talk to the monitor, we use this driver to "lie" to the kernel, telling it a 720p60 display is always connected. This enables the `/dev/dri/card0` device to initialize correctly.

## Usage Guide
These source folders are not standalone projects. They are intended to be integrated into your Vivado and PetaLinux workflows as instructed in the specific tutorial steps.

*   **Hardware:** You will add `axis_to_video` as a source directory in Vivado.
*   **Software:** You will copy `xlnx_dummy_connector` into your PetaLinux `project-spec/meta-user/recipes-modules/` directory to include it in the kernel build.
